      <p class="item-tekst">To keep it short, what makes someone a magical girl are three things: transformation, magic and fighting evil. Of course this isn’t all of it, but these are the key ingredients. With almost every other aspect of the magical girl genre, the creator is allowed to play around with their own fantasies.
        </p>


      <p class="item-tekst">Despite this not being the necessary, I can teach you about some things most magical girls have in common. </p>

        <ul class="item-list">
        <li>Most magical girls are young girls between the ages of 12 to 16 (with exceptions, either being younger or older). </li>
       <li>Often when there’s one magical girl, more will appear in the story, though this might not always be the case, like in the popular 1990’s anime Cardcaptor Sakura (though there is another magic user called Syaoran Li, he is not considered a magical girl for obvious reasons).</li>
<li>In most situations a magical companion will appear to teach the magical girl about her newly awakened powers and guide her on her journey. Though this is one of the most commonly missing factors, especially when it comes to more modern magical girls.</li>
<li>Not really a rule or anything, but for some reason pink is a very common theme colour among magical girls, especially the group leaders.</li>
          </ul>

<p class="item-tekst">
But like I said, just because these are common things, not every story keeps these factors. You don’t even have to be a girl to be considered part of the magical girl genre, though these characters (like Syaoran Li) will be called magical boys, they are considered a subgenre in the genre itself.
