      <p>Now that you understand magical girls a little better, it is time for me to teach you about its history.
      </p>

      <p>
        The magical girl genre originated in Japan in the 1960’s, being popular among young girls and flipping the gender aspect that was usually associated with western superheroes. This new genre originated from the 1962 manga “Himistu no Akko-chan” followed by “Sally the Witch” in 1966. After many manga’s that followed similar plotlines in the 1970’s, this genre was given the name “Majokko” meaning little witch. It wasn’t until in the late 1970’s came out with shows like “Mahō Shōjo Raraberu” and “Lalabel, the Magical Girl” that this genre really became known as the Magical Girl Genre. However it wasn’t until 1985 that the magical girl genre became popular in western countries with the show “She-Ra: Princess of Power”. Tho the first magical girl influenced series that was translated into English was “Cutey Honey”, it was not targeted towards younger girls, unlike it’s counter parts.

      <p>The 1990’s and 2000’s are considered to be the era when magical girls were most popular, coming out with series like “Sailor Moon”, “Revolutionary Girl Utena”, “Tokyo Mew Mew” and “Cardcaptor Sakura”. Also was this the start of a still ongoing magical girl franchise called Pretty Cure. This is also the time that more Japanese magical girl animes were dubbed into English and aired on tv. Often changing their Japanese names and deleting queer representation.
        “Did you know that it was quite common for these magical girl animes to have queer representation and that four of the five previously named animes include them? Sailor Moon being the most well known one with both gay and lesbian characters/couples as well as genderqueer representing ones.”
